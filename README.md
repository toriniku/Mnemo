Mnemonics
=========

In this repository, we try to create a set of 100 PAO-triplets that can be used
as mnemonics to remember 6 digit numbers. Memorizing at least one mnemonic per
day should result in knowing the entire set in a little over three months.

For every mnemonic, three highly imaginable elements are used:
* P = Person
* A = Action
* O = Object

00 (A hacker) (wildly running circles around) (a rotten egg)
--

The hacker is a generalization of Zero Cool, a main character in the movie
[Hackers] [00-0]. Represented by the two circles of this number is the action of
running those circles. To make the action vivid, imagine running very fast and
making wild sounds. Again represented by the two circles is the egg, which can
be made vivid by adding smell: they're rotten and stink badly.

01 (The US president) (making a dance of joy with) (a huge #1 trophy)
--

The person is in this mnemonic is the president of the USA for his influence on
the world. Picking an individual president makes a vivid image, like the one fo
[Abraham Lincoln] [01-0]. The action is a dance of joy one makes when being #1.
Finally, the object in this mnemonic is an enormous trofee that is awarded to
the winner.

02 (Luigi) (dancing the tango with) (a dove)
--

[Luigi] [02-0] is just the second half of the Mario and Luigi duo. Being the
second makes him a good candidate for this number, but his tall body and vivid
green color in his clothing makes him very memorable. As action, dancing the
[tango] [02-1] has a reference to the South American dance with staccato
movements. As object, the [dove] [02-2] references a symbol of peace, being pure
in the white color, which allows for a bright image. Alternatively, imagining a
dove with different, but bright, colors can also create a vivid image.

03 (Our Dear Leader) (looking at) (candy)
--

[Our Dear Leader] [03-0] can easily be remembered as the "third rank" leader.
For years, there have been the website [Kim Jong-il looking at things] [03-1]
which makes the action "looking at" a good image for this number. One of the
more memorable episodes on this website is the one where the leader is [looking
at a candy bucket] [03-2]. Candy can be formed in a very memorable image,
focussing on vivid colors and a sweet taste.

04 (Michalangelo) (sculpting) (a ninja weapon)
--

As a team of four, the [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles] [04-0] is a perfectly
suitable team for this number. The turtle with the orange mask is [Michelangelo]
[04-1] acts as the person for this image and his [nunchaku] [04-2] can easily
be the object. So what is he doing with his ninja weapon? He is sculpting it!

06 (A viking) (throwing) (a mobile phone)
--

The viking refers to the mobile operator [Mobile Vikings] [06-0] and can be a
very vivid image. It's absurd to see a viking throwing a mobile phone, so that
should be easily rememberable. The object in this image is a mobile phone, since
in The Netherlands all cell phone numbers start with 06.

12 (Sonic the Hedgehog) (waiting with) (a watch)
--

[Sonic the Hedgehog] [12-0] is a vivid image with a nice blue skin, always quick
and always waiting for anything and everbody. Twelve is the number of hours
displayed on a clock. An action related to a clock is waiting. The object in
this image is a watch, which can be a memorable image when seen as hi-tech watch
with a lot of buttons.

35 Jules Deelder writing on a printer
--

In internet standards, port 35 is reserved for ["any private printer server"]
[35-0], which makes for a perfect object. The person doing something with the
printer is [Jules Deelder (Dutch)] [35-1], a well known Dutch poet and writer.
He is very rememberable by his block clothes and slick hair. The action he
takes, of course, is writing. Writing on a printer.
